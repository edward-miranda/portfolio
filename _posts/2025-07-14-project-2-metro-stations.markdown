description: City planners metro investors in Prague, Czech Republic are interested in the health and reliability of the Prague metro system. Transaction data is generated each time a passenger taps their metro pass and is stored in a local database. Using Airflow as our orchestrator, we crafted a script to ingest data from the remote database into our data lake (S3 bucket).
